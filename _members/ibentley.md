My research is focused on understanding the molecular underpinnings of ventilator induced lung injury. When I am not in the lab, my other academic and clinical interests are in the intensive care unit building a practice caring for critically ill patients. These patients frequently require mechanical ventilation and at risk of ventilator induced lung injury.  This connection between my research and clinical work allows me to take lessons learned in the lab back to the bedside and vice versa. Outside of the hospital, I love to spend time with my wife, son, and cat. When my son is sleeping, my hobbies include playing and watching basketball, playing pickleball, working in the yard, hiking, eating and drinking, and playing video games
