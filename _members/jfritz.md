I completed my undergraduate degree in Physics at Carnegie Mellon University. Iâ€™m currently a Biophysics PhD student and recently completed my candidacy exam.  I am co-advised by Dr. Englert and Dr. Samir Ghadiali in the Department of Biomedical Engineering.  The focus of my research is mechanisms of lung cell membrane repair and surfactant dynamics.  I use both experimental and computational tools in my work. In my free time, I enjoy playing board games with friends, playing video games, and exploring Columbus' food scene!
