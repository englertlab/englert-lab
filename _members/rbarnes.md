My name is Ryelie Barnes and I am an undergraduate Medical Anthropology major with minors in Medical Humanities and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. I am originally from northeast Ohio and have been in the lab since 2021. Outside of academics, I spend a lot of time doing wellness outreach, going to concerts, and reading.
