# Introduction

This wiki was adapted from the Greene Lab's wiki, including Englert-Lab specific changes, as well as making it more user-friendly for first-time developers and maintainers of the website.&#x20;



While I will not always be available following the final production build of this website, I am reachable by email at [thow.3@osu.edu](mailto:thow.3@osu.edu). In order to ensure timeliness of a response, please use the subject header \[ENGLERT LAB - HELP], along with the general urgency of the help required.



I also strongly encourage you to read the Greene Lab docs for the most accurate information to date.
