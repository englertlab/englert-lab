The plugin has many useful features beyond the standard capabilities of Markdown, including:

* Advanced tables
  * Row/col merging
  * No header
  * Individual cell alignment
  * Markdown within cells
* Math notation with LaTeX, MathML, or AsciiMath
* Diagramming with PlantUML or Mermaid
* Rich media embeds
  * Youtube
  * Vimeo
  * DailyMotion
  * Spotify
  * SoundCloud
* GitHub-flavored emoji, e.g. `:+1` -> :thumbsup:

See [Jekyll Spaceship's documentation](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-spaceship) for examples of how to easily do all of this right in your Markdown.
