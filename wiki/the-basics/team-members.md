# üßëü§ùüßë Team Members

## Add/remove members

To add or remove a team member, create or delete a Markdown file in `/_members`.&#x20;

Each file will automatically generate its own page according to its filename. For example, a file with the name `tim-member.md` will generate a page at `/members/tim-member`.

{% hint style="info" %}
For ease of future updates, try to standardise a way of naming. For example, I have elected to use the first initial and the individuals last name. For example "jenglert"
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
After adding members, you can display them on your site with the [list](broken-reference) and [portrait](broken-reference) components.
{% endhint %}

Example:

{% code title="jenglert.md" %}
```markdown

The skeleton arrangement and style of team member pages are based on the `/_layouts/member.html` template, which you can freely edit to your liking.
