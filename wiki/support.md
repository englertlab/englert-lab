### Supported Browsers

The Greene Lab regularly tests the template on the following browsers, and by extension, the Englert Lab website should also function on them:

* Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari
* Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android
* Desktop, tablet, phone/mobile

The Englert Lab (and Greene Lab!) only use standardized and widely-supported HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features, so any other modern, standard-compliant browser such as Opera or Microsoft Edge should also work, even if not explicitly tested.â€‹The following at **NOT** supported, and may result in an unexpected look or behaviour:

* Microsoft Internet Explorer
* Smart Watches, or any device with a screen width < \~250px
* Browsers without JavaScript enabled (interactive features won't work)
