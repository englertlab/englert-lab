# Zinc metabolism in ARDS

[Our prior work](https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/86507) demonstrated that zinc deficiency predisposes the lung to injury during mechanical ventilation.  In partnership with collaborators at Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital and the University of Vermont Medical Center we recently completed a prospective observational study of zinc metabolism in over 650 ICU patients that may lay the groundwork for a clinical trial of zinc supplementation in ARDS patients.
