# Translational studies of critically-ill ICU patients

To translate findings from his laboratory research, Dr. Englert has partnered with other experts in the field to build biorepositories of biologic specimens and clinical data from hundreds ICU patients.  These data and biospecimens have been used to investigate the molecular mechanisms of ARDS within different phenotypic groups including patients with [cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8478963/) and those that have undergone [stem cell transplantation](https://respiratory-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12931-019-0981-6).  In addition to these observational studies, Dr. Englert has been an investigator on over 30 ICU clinical trials.
